// Experimental and opt-in (TOLKARA_VM_BUDGET_MB): iPadOS caps a process's
// virtual reservations near 64 GB and charges them when they are made, while
// a macOS application may reserve pools for a far larger address space
// (Cyberpunk 2077: about 118 GB) and fail on a pool it did not get.
//
// Large anonymous reservations the kernel places are counted against a budget
// and, beyond it, mapped smaller than asked, ending in a PROT_NONE guard page,
// where the whole span asked for is free address space and does not overlap
// another counted reservation's requested span. If no such location can be
// mapped, the reservation fails. The application still believes it has the
// whole region, so the
// missing part is never unmapped, protected or advised for it (other code's
// mappings may come to live there); a fixed mapping into it, or an mprotect
// that would make any of it usable, fails with ENOMEM as for unmapped memory;
// the application's own later mappings there stay its own. Touching memory
// past what was granted faults at the guard page, or beyond it reaches
// whatever was placed there since.
