# Contributing

Thanks for helping. The most useful contributions are API coverage for a new
application, a compatibility report, and device test results.

## Ground rules

These are not negotiable, because they are what keeps the project a
compatibility layer:

- Never commit third-party application code, assets, shaders, captured memory,
  page containers, or anything copied out of macOS or iPadOS. Tests use our own
  synthetic fixtures from `testguest/` and `tests/`.
- Never patch, re-sign or repackage an application's executable. Tolkara's own
  code is signed. With Local signing, each user builds and signs their own page
  container on their own machine, with their own identity, for their own iPad.
- No features that read or change a running application's memory beyond loading
  it, no input automation, and no workarounds for anti-cheat, licence or
  integrity checks. See "Policy" in the [README](README.md).
- Never commit signing teams, device identifiers, pairing records, provisioning
  profiles, credentials, or files from `build/` and `logs/`. Personal settings
  belong in the ignored `local.env`.
- If your change is based on someone else's code, say so and add its licence to
  [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md). Reading public protocol documentation is fine.

## Workflow

```bash
tools/test_emulation.sh
```

must pass; it enforces `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` and runs under ASan and UBSan.
Add a focused test for memory bounds, malformed input, protocol failures and
adapter behaviour you touch. Tests are standalone executables or Python
`unittest` files named `tests/test_*.{c,m,swift,py}`.

Style: four-space indentation in source files, two in YAML; match the code
around you and do not reformat unrelated lines. Keep the module prefixes
(`gm_`, `gi_`, `ng_` in the runtime, `AK` in the translation layer, `TK` in
authorization).

Pull requests should explain the problem, the resulting behaviour, the commands
you ran with their results, and what is still untested. A simulator pass does
not prove Metal or native-execution behaviour; say which device you tested on.

## Supporting a new application

1. Build with your executable (`GUEST_EXE`); `build/native-*/SURFACE.md` lists
   every macOS symbol it imports and which are missing.
2. Run it and read `Documents/native-guest.log`. Generated stubs log the first
   call to each unimplemented function.
3. Implement what it needs under `translation/<Framework>/`, with a test.
4. Add a profile under `profiles/` and a row in
   [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md).
