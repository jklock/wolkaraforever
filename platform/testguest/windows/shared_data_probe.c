/*
 * Windows test program for the Wine runtime under Tolkara (docs/WINDOWS.md).
 *
 * Built for x86-64 with the LLVM mingw toolchain the runtime build downloads:
 *   build/windows-runtime/llvm-mingw/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-clang -O1 -fms-extensions \
 *       testguest/windows/shared_data_probe.c -o build/windows-runtime/shared_data_probe.exe
 *
 * It checks what a program sees when KUSER_SHARED_DATA is not at 0x7ffe0000:
 * the APIs that read it through Wine's own pointer (GetTickCount64,
 * QueryPerformanceCounter, GetSystemTimeAsFileTime) must work, and a direct
 * read of 0x7ffe0000, which some programs hardcode, is reported rather than
 * assumed: on a host where nothing can be mapped there it faults, and that
 * tells us whether the emulator has to catch it.

/* The read happens in a call: clang's __try covers calls, not a plain load
