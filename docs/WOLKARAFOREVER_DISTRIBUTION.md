# Sharing WolkaraForever

Assessment: 2026-10-06. WolkaraForever is a WoW-focused fork of Tolkara. Changing its
name, home screen or distribution channel does not change iOS code-execution
requirements. The public fork is distributed as source for personal Xcode builds. No tested
public WolkaraForever IPA or notarized build is provided. See [Getting started](GETTING_STARTED.md)
and the [fresh-install checklist](FRESH_INSTALL_TEST.md).

## What is currently demonstrated

The existing personal setup uses Xcode signing, the integrated Developer service
target, Developer Mode and one-time device enrolment. Forever gameplay and
Mac-disconnected reboot/launch were reported on an iPhone 16 Pro Max. Those
reports do not prove cellular-only startup, the latest updater revision, or a
fresh install using another user's signing identity. See [COMPATIBILITY.md](../COMPATIBILITY.md).

The updater can check editions and install patches while open. A first full
real-game download is still unvalidated. The controls editor has simulator/signed-build coverage and user-confirmed
physical-game use. A separate clean-install run remains necessary.

Normal launches automatically use the route compiled into the app: Developer
service for the integrated target, External JIT for the diagnostics/sideload
target. The home does not offer Local signing or other startup alternatives.
Explicit development arguments retain those tools. Removing the picker does
not remove the route's preparation, enrolment or signing requirements.

## Practical distribution choices

Expanded research, 2026-10-06: SideStore is one delivery option, not a required
dependency. The key distinction is development signing versus distribution
signing, independently of the installer's name or Debug/Release build setting.
[Apple DTS explains](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/823069) that
development profiles permit `get-task-allow`; distribution profiles, including
Ad Hoc, do not. Both our current Developer service preparation and External JIT
need access to the host process before guest entry. A successfully installed IPA
is therefore not evidence that its signing method permits WoW execution.

| Route | Installation experience | WolkaraForever status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Personal Xcode build | Mac, own developer signing, Developer Mode, initial enrolment | Closest to the setup with recorded gameplay; still a developer workflow. |
| Small beta, development-signed for registered devices | Maintainer builds/signs; a desktop helper could install and enrol the device without asking testers to use Xcode | Promising first pilot using the existing integrated route; helper and clean-device flow not yet built/tested. Device-registration and certificate limits apply. |
| iLoader or Sideloadly, direct IPA | Desktop installer, USB, user's Apple Account; no compilation by the user | Good general sideloading candidates. Need actual re-signing/entitlement and execution tests; generic IPA currently selects unvalidated External JIT. |
| SideStore / AltStore Classic source | Add a source; supports launcher updates and signature refresh through the user's setup | Useful especially for users already using them, not the only recommended install method. |
| Paid development-certificate service / Feather | Device registration and signing through a service or imported certificate, potentially on-device | Worth a pilot, not a confirmed solution. Require a development profile, correct memory/tunnel/keychain entitlements and initial authorization; a distribution-only certificate will not suffice. |
| TestFlight / App Store | Familiar install and update experience; TestFlight supports public invitation links | Current preparation relies on development-only debugging permission. These channels do not provide a working native WoW route with the current design. |
| AltStore PAL / official web distribution | Marketplace/source or authorized website install | Notarization and distribution requirements remain; no demonstrated compatible native-execution path. |
| LiveContainer | Import WolkaraForever into another app | Its lack of guest extension support conflicts with our integrated tunnel. JIT-less hosting of an iOS wrapper does not authorize unsigned Mac game pages; External JIT would require separate investigation. |
| TrollStore | Permanent IPA installation on its supported old iOS versions | Its published support excludes the modern iPhone/iOS setup tested here. Not a general-user route. |

[iLoader](https://iloader.app/) supports arbitrary IPAs on macOS, Windows and
Linux, plus pairing-file setup for supported apps. That does not establish
compatibility with our custom enrolment format. Its announced browser installer
is beta and its iOS 27 wireless pairing is work in progress; neither should be
advertised as a proven phone-only WolkaraForever setup.

[Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/faq) supports automatic refresh when a computer
can reach the phone by USB or Wi-Fi. Its documentation gives seven days for free
signing and up to a year for paid developer signing. Signature refresh and game
content updates are separate operations.

For a small development-signed pilot, Apple permits registration of up to
[100 devices per product family per membership year](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/devices/devices-overview/).
This is not an unlimited Reddit distribution method. Testers would still need
Developer Mode, device trust and enrolment; our signing private key stays with
the maintainer and device pairing secrets stay local. A Windows version of the
helper would need to replace the current Mac/Xcode-specific enrolment tooling.

[Signulous](https://www.signulous.com/) now advertises development and
distribution certificates and JIT support. These are vendor claims, not a
WolkaraForever test or a guarantee against revocation. Check the resulting profiles
and all required entitlements before recommending purchase.
[Feather](https://github.com/claration/feather) is an on-device certificate-based
installer with source support; it is not an independent grant of those permissions.

[TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/testflight-overview/)
offers up to 10,000 external testers, reviewed builds and 90-day build validity.
The present blocker is execution permission as well as distribution review.
[Official EU web distribution](https://developer.apple.com/support/web-distribution-eu/)
requires authorization and notarization; it is not a plain IPA download link.
Enterprise distribution is for an organization's internal apps/employees, not
[a public Reddit release](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/).

[LiveContainer's documented limits](https://github.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer#limitations)
include guest entitlements not applying to the host and guest extensions not
being supported. Its separate JIT support needs appropriate setup on newer iOS.
[TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore) lists iOS 14.0 beta 2–16.6.1,
16.7 RC and 17.0, excluding 17.0.1 and later.

[SideStore's prerequisites](https://docs.sidestore.io/docs/installation/prerequisites)
include a computer for initial installation, an Apple Account and connected
Wi-Fi. Its LocalDevVPN must be active for app installation, updates and refresh.
These are store operations, distinct from downloading WoW content inside WolkaraForever.

[AltStore Classic's remote-server documentation](https://faq.altstore.io/altstore-classic/remote-altservers)
also describes installing/refreshing without the computer after pairing, using
LocalDevVPN and a connected Wi-Fi network. This does not establish cellular-only
WolkaraForever launch or solve its executable-memory preparation.

An External JIT build needs an enabler. [StikDebug](https://github.com/StikDebug/StikDebug)
is a candidate: its own instructions require pairing/setup and describe limited
app compatibility on newer iOS releases. We have not tested that combination.
Our loader must still obtain executable memory and confirm debugger detachment
before entering any game code.

[PAL distribution](https://faq.altstore.io/developers/distribute-with-altstore-pal)
requires Apple notarization, marketplace processing and hosting the Alternative
Distribution Package before publishing a source. Our engineering conclusion is
that listing WolkaraForever there cannot itself authorize execution of downloaded Mac
code. No PAL-compatible execution permission or successful test is claimed.

## Before recommending it to nontechnical users

1. Validate one clean installation from start to finish on a separate device:
   signing, first game download, update, login, restart, input and recovery.
2. For the IPA route, validate External JIT and memory capacity with the actual
   signing tier. Free signing drops increased-memory and extended-address-space
   entitlements in the current packaging workflow; compilation is not proof
   that the full client will fit.
3. Validate login in the distributable build. The public release workflow sets
   `TOLKARA_SYSTEM_ROOTS=NO` explicitly to exclude roots exported from macOS;
   running `wolkaraforever/tools/package_ipa.sh` alone defaults to YES. Public packaging must
   use NO, unlike the personal build tested here. Provide a redistributable
   trust-store solution if needed; never
   disable TLS validation or bundle private signing/enrolment material.
4. Confirm cold startup using mobile data, with no nearby Mac or Wi-Fi. Current
   documentation records a failure and an unvalidated recovery sequence.
5. Publish only our app/runtime and original assets, retaining MIT/third-party
   notices and the independent-project attribution. Never include game files,
   account data, pairing records, personal identifiers, captures or certificates
   exported from macOS. Users obtain authorized game content themselves.

## Suggested Reddit rollout

Prioritize a small development-signed pilot with a desktop setup assistant over
requiring every tester to compile the project. The target experience is:
connect phone, accept the system prompts, press Install, complete local
enrolment, then choose/download an edition in WolkaraForever. This assistant is a
proposal, not an implemented or validated workflow.

For broader distribution, compare direct iLoader/Sideloadly installation against
a paid development-certificate route using the same clean-device acceptance
tests. Existing SideStore/AltStore users can use a compatible source as an
additional convenience. Do not tie the app architecture to one installer.

The Reddit post can then link a short demo and one installation landing page
that recommends a route based on available computer, signing choice and iOS
version. Prefer a single validated default, with alternatives clearly labeled.
No paid account, service, certificate or public distribution was set up here.

Describe it as a community experiment until another person can complete the
clean-device flow. Do not advertise one-tap installation, PAL availability,
cellular-only startup, or account safety on the strength of a local build or
simulator test. Updating WolkaraForever through a source and updating WoW from its CDN
are two different operations.
