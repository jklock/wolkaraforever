# Notices

WolkaraForever is a WoW-focused fork of Tolkara, by Vasilii Kharitonov and the Tolkara
contributors. The original runtime, translation layer and history are retained.
WolkaraForever additions are provided under the same MIT license.

Tolkara is released under the MIT License. It uses Apple's public SDK frameworks,
the system zlib library and the Python standard library. The experimental WoW
manifest reader includes adaptations described below.

The following public material was consulted as **reference documentation** for
protocols and formats. No code was copied or translated from these projects.

- Remote Pairing protocol description by Jackson Coxson
  (jkcoxson.com/blog/rppairing-spec)
- pymobiledevice3 (GPL-3.0), consulted for RemoteXPC and service-discovery
  message layouts
- StikJIT integration notes (executable-region preparation protocol)
- Apple HomeKit ADK (Apache-2.0), Pair Verify reference
- Apple open-source objc4 headers, for the Objective-C image registration SPI
- Apple open-source dyld `MachOAnalyzer.cpp`, for rebase stream termination
  semantics (https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/dyld/blob/main/common/MachOAnalyzer.cpp);
  no implementation code copied
- LLVM libunwind_ext.h (Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception), for the Darwin dynamic
  unwind-section lookup SPI declarations; registration code is original
- GDB remote serial protocol and LLDB `debugserver` extension documentation
- RFC 9293 (TCP), RFC 8200 (IPv6), RFC 7748 (X25519), RFC 5054 (SRP)

`translation/CoreServices/USKeyMap.h` is a table of the characters produced by
a standard US ANSI keyboard, checked against macOS behaviour. System trust roots
are not stored in this repository; `platform/tools/export_system_anchors.m` exports the
public certificates from the builder's own Mac at build time. The unsigned build
published with releases leaves them out.

If you contribute code derived from another project, say so in the pull request
and add its licence here.

## Experimental WoW launcher

The BLTE, install-manifest and encoding-manifest readers in
`wolkaraforever/WoW/Manifest.m` and the archive reader in `wolkaraforever/WoW/CASC.m` were adapted using TACTSharp's `BLTE.cs`,
`InstallInstance.cs`, `EncodingInstance.cs` and `IndexInstance.cs` (https://github.com/wowdev/TACTSharp).
This implementation adds bounded parsing, checksum validation and synthetic tests.
TACTSharp itself and its .NET runtime are not bundled. No game files are included.

The local CASC index format and archive footer reader in `wolkaraforever/WoW/CASC.m`
were adapted with reference to CascLib's `CascIndexFiles.cpp` and
`CascStructs.h` (https://github.com/ladislav-zezula/CascLib).
CascLib is not bundled. Public download/storage format documentation was also
consulted at https://github.com/d07RiV/blizzget/wiki; no blizzget code is copied.

`TKWoWJenkins` adapts Bob Jenkins' `lookup3.c` (May 2006, public domain):
https://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/lookup3.c. It is used for the local index's
format checksum, not for cryptographic authentication.
